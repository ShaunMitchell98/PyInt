# PyInt

PyInt is a Python Interpreter based on the Clox interpreter by Bob Nystrom from https://craftinginterpreters.com/

By default, when you run the executable it starts a REPL, where you can run code quickly. By passing arguements, you can get additional output such as the executed bytecode and the state of the stack.

The output doesn't have to be to the terminal, output can be redirected to a file by replacing t with f and adding the file path as the next input, for example:

As well as writing commands in the terminal, you can run a file using the arguement -fi and passing the filepath:
